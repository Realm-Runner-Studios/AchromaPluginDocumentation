Migrate Guide - If you are using UniWebViewHelper\&.RunningOnRetinaIOS() to decide the insets of \fBUniWebView\fP, you may want to look at the Migrate Guide: 
.RE
.PP
Due to introduction of iPhone 6 Plus and its new @3x scale, the old way would not work well\&. Now, all screen-size-based insets calculation for \fBUniWebView\fP should NOT use RunningOnRetinaIOS anymore\&. Instead you should use UniWebViewHelper\&.screenHeight and UniWebViewHelper\&.screenWidth and specify the point directly\&. For example, if you want to show a web view taking the upper half of screen, before version 1\&.7\&.0, it might be something like this: 
.PP
.nf
int uiFactor = UniWebViewHelper\&.RunningOnRetinaIOS() ? 2 : 1;
int bottomInset = Screen\&.height / ( 2 * uiFactor );
_webView\&.insets = new UniWebViewEdgeInsets(0,0,bottomInset,0);

.fi
.PP
 Right now, with the new API, you can just use this: 
.PP
.nf
int bottomInset = (int)(UniWebViewHelper\&.screenHeight * 0\&.5f);
_webView\&.insets = new UniWebViewEdgeInsets(0,0,bottomInset,0);

.fi
.PP
 No more ui factor and device-specified calculation needed\&.
.PP
To make sure you can notice this change, the usage of RunningOnRetinaIOS() will cause an error now\&. You can just delete all usage of that, and change your insets code like the example above\&.
