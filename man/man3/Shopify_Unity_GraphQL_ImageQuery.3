The location of the original image as a URL\&. If there are any existing transformations in the original source URL, they will remain and not be stripped\&.

.RS 4
Previously an image had a single \fCsrc\fP field\&. This could either return the original image location or a URL that contained transformations such as sizing or scale\&.
.RE

.PP
These transformations were specified by arguments on the parent field\&.
.PP
Now an image has two distinct URL fields: \fCoriginalSrc\fP and \fCtransformedSrc\fP\&.
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCoriginalSrc\fP - the original unmodified image URL
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fCtransformedSrc\fP - the image URL with the specified transformations included
.PP
.PP
To migrate to the new fields, image transformations should be moved from the parent field to \fCtransformedSrc\fP\&.
