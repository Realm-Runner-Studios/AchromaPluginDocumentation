.SH "Shopify SDK for Unity Examples"
.PP
This repo contains an example of how to use the Shopify SDK for Unity (https://github.com/Shopify/unity-buy-sdk)\&. The SDK allows Unity developers to sell products from their Shopify store (https://www.shopify.ca/) directly within games and other interactive experiences made within Unity\&.
.SS "Getting started"
To get started, either checkout this project using Git, or download as a zip\&. The project can be opened in the Unity editor, a free trial version is available here https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal\&. The Shopify SDK for Unity functionality is integrated as a shop within a pop up menu\&. The Shopify SDK for Unity has already been included into this example, but in general, an integration is started by downloading and including the https://github.com/Shopify/unity-buy-sdk/blob/master/shopify-buy.unitypackage into the target project\&.
.SS "Quickstart tutorial"
The example is comprised of a shop popup menu which demonstrates the usage of the Shopify SDK for Unity\&. While it is entirely possible to do a complete integration from scratch, the shop popup from this example can also be directly included into your game, and later tweaked to match a visual style\&. For information on how to get the example shop popup integrated into a game in a few steps, please see the \fCquickstart tutorial\fP\&.
.SS "Tutorial"
For more details on how the example was created, and detailed steps that can be followed for integrating the Shopify SDK for Unity into other games, please see the \fCfull tutorial\fP\&.
